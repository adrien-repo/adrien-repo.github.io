	Hi there ! 
	<br><br>
	My name is Adrien, I am a 31 y.o. French engineer and geographer living in Montreux, Switzerland.
	<br><br>
	I work in the hedge fund space, assisting research for a multi-family office to source all liquid strategies and implement equity-focused portfolio management. I have a deep interest in quantitative finance and statistical modeling though I try not to be overly impressed by mathematical elegance - at least, during working hours ! You will find listed the personal pages of some researchers and professors I highly regard. 
	<br><br>
	Prior to that, I have held various roles in agricultural commodities trading, the Ministry of Defense, and a large French NGO I am still a member of. Travel broadens the mind and I have now embarked on another kind of lifelong journey in marrying the amazing Jessica. We are lucky being surrounded by lovely families and friends, and are the proud owners of a small dog. We have shared beautiful moments in places grouped in the Photographies section.
	<br><br>
	I am a heavy reader and appreciate watching documentaries. I also irregularly attend online courses on scientific subjects. I enjoy daily chess playing and occasionally do home-brewing, both with more or less success.
	<br><br>
	I have built this site as a substitute for social platforms I found too time-consuming, and to host some extra-professional coding projects. 
	<br><br>
	Have a nice tour !
