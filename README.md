Reader is a basic newsreader that focus on content.

Articles lists are sourced from RSS feeds and displayed via Google Material design cards.

News feeds can be added by editing the code of left panel menu (calling a generic href JavaScript function with RSS as argument).

Each article is then parsed via Readability to display text-only and spread up the reading.
