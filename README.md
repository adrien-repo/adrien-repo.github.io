## Welcome

I manage investment strategies and conduct research for asset managers and family offices. I took detours across few continents into commodity trading, NGOs, government and military roles.

I am into chess, coding, astronomy, and music. I am an engineer and geographer by training, and use the Internet to dive into books, documentaries, and online courses. Free knowledge, late-night math? Count me in.

Collaboration, idea-sharing, and casual conversation can begin here:

You will find on this website some insights into what sparks my curiosity. Enjoy your visit!
